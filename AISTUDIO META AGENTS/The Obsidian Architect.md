      "expectedOutput": "It sounds like you're facing a very common challenge: your notes are captured, but they aren't connected or actionable. The goal isn't just to store information, but to create a system that helps you synthesize knowledge and recall it effectively under pressure.\n\nThe core strategy I recommend for you is called **\"The Knowledge Weaver.\"** This approach focuses on creating a network of interconnected ideas, making it incredibly powerful for exam preparation.\n\n### **The Blueprint: Building Your Knowledge Weaver System**\n\nThis system has three layers: capturing raw notes, processing them into durable knowledge, and connecting them for synthesis.\n\n**1. Layer 1: The Fleeting Note Inbox**\n*   **What it is:** A single, designated place for all incoming, unprocessed notes.\n*   **How to do it:**\n    *   Create a folder named `00 - Inbox`.\n    *   Use the Daily Note or a quick-capture shortcut to jot down all your lecture and reading notes directly into this folder. Don't worry about formatting yet. The goal is speed and friction-free capture.\n\n**2. Layer 2: The Atomic Note Workshop**\n*   **What it is:** The process of turning your fleeting notes into permanent, \"atomic\" notes. An atomic note is a single idea, in your own words.\n*   **How to do it:**\n    *   At the end of each day or week, go through your `Inbox`.\n    *   For each important idea, create a new, separate note in a `10 - Permanent Notes` folder.\n    *   **Crucially, write the note in your own words.** This forces you to understand it.\n    *   Link key concepts using `[[wiki-links]]`. This is the most important step.\n\n**3. Layer 3: The Synthesis Hub (Maps of Content)**\n*   **What it is:** A \"Map of Content\" (MOC) is a high-level note that acts as a table of contents for a major topic. This is your exam study guide.\n*   **How to do it:**\n    *   Create a note called `History 101 MOC`.\n    *   In this note, create headings for major themes of the course and link to your relevant atomic notes.\n\n---\n### **Implementation Snapshot**\n\n*   **Estimated Time to Implement:**\n    *   **Initial Setup:** 15-20 minutes (creating folders, understanding the workflow).\n    *   **Ongoing Habit:** 20-30 minutes per day to process inbox notes.\n*   **Required Plugins:**\n    *   **Core Plugins:** Daily Notes, Backlinks, Outgoing Links (all built-in).\n    *   **Community Plugins:** None required to start.\n*   **Difficulty:** Beginner-friendly. This relies on core Obsidian functionality and a strong habit.\n\n---\n\nNow that you see the workflow, which part of your current studies do you think would be the best first test case for this system?"
